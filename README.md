A Python3 program I wrote for an assignment of a course called HSS 322: Computational Linguistics.
You can view the assignment problem [here](http://bit.ly/bigram-hss-322)

## Prerequisites

You need python3 installed, and need to store a file called "mothergoosecorpus.txt" in the same directory as the py file. You can also find this file in the repository.

```
<s> peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers </s>
<s> a peck of pickled peppers peter piper picked </s>
<s> if peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers </s>
<s> where s the peck of pickled peppers peter piper picked </s>
```

## Running it from commandline
For Linux/Unix:
```python
python3 comp_ling.py
```
For Windows:
```
python comp_ling.py
```
